# JavaFX Fractal Raytracer

A simple raytracing program which renders still images and animations of of 3D fractals and other shapes.

## Features

### Implemented

* Multithreading support
* Keyframe-based animation system
* A variety of fractals and other interesting shapes to explore
* Lots of configurable parameters
* Shading and ghosting effects

### Todo

* Animated help graphics
* Code documentation
* More fun shapes!

### Out of Scope

* GPU acceleration
* Direct export of animated image or video files ([apngasm](https://github.com/apngasm/apngasm) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) can help with this)

### Development History

The author wanted to play with some three-dimensional analogues of the famous [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), so he wrote a raytracer to render it. Then he thought it needed to be prettier, so he implemented color and shading... but it was still difficult to visualize three-dimensionally, so he added animation support too. He thought it would be nice to share this creation with others, so the user interface was tidied up and improved. And it seems the internet is a good place to share software, so here it is. Enjoy!

### Message from the Author

Please remember that this software was written for fun in two weeks by an amateur programmer. There is certainly potential for further performance optimizations, code restructuring, bug fixing, etc. so feel free to make suggestions!
